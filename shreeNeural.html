                            <p> As we all know the brain is the central organ of the human body. But how does it work?? Your brain consists of billions of nerve cells called neurons arranged in a pattern that coordinate your thoughts, behaviour, movements and sensations.<br>
                                As an attempt to replicate the human brain and in order to make things more intelligent a software (or hardware) simulation called NEURAL NETWORKS was created. The also called ANN or Artificial neural network was first invented by psychologist Frank Rosenblatt in 1958 and called it Perceptron, intended to process visual data, learn to recognize objects and to study human cognition.<br>
                                It belongs to a branch of field known as Artificial Intelligence as once this neural network has been trained on samples of your data, it can make predictions by detecting similar patterns in future.<br>
                                In other words Neural Networks are nothing but a set of algorithms, modelled loosely after the human brain that interprets sensory data through a kind of machine perception, labelling or clustering of the raw inputs.<br>
                                The Neural Network must first be trained by having it process a large number of input patterns and showing it what output results from each pattern.<br>
                                It learns to map inputs to outputs and also find correlations between them. It is known as Universal approximator, as it can learn to approximate an unknown function f(x) =y between any input x and any output y. In the course of the learning process the neural network finds the right f, or the correct manner of transforming x into y. <br>
                                Humans must transfer their knowledge to the dataset in order for a neural network to learn. When exposed to enough of the right data, it can establish the correlation between the present events and future events. That is, when given a time series, deep learning may read a string of numbers and predicts the number more likely to occur next.<br>
                                By now, we know that Neural Network works by learning and processing the data. This learning is of three categories:<br>
                                <blockquote>1. Supervised Learning <br>
                                        (Have a labelled dataset to train on)<br>
                                        2. Unsupervised Learning<br>
                                        (Clustering or grouping on unlabelled data which is the majority in the world)<br>
                                        3. Reinforcement Learning<br>
                                        (Based on probability)</blockquote><br>
                                        Now after the neural network have been trained with enough number of algorithms let’s get into the working.
                                        An Artificial Neural Network is basically made up of three components: 
                                        1. Input Layer<br>
                                        2. Hidden (computation) Layer<br>
                                        3. Output Layer<br>
                                        Furthermore the learn happens in two steps:<br>
                                 <blockquote>
                                     1. Forward-Propagation <br>
                                     2. Back-Propagation
                                 </blockquote>   <br>
                                 In simple words, forward propagation is making a guess about the answer while back-propagation is minimizing the errors between the actual answer and guessed answer. 
Let’s get more detailed into each of the layers, their components and working.
The first layer- INPUT LAYER of the neural network consist of artificial input neurons, that bring the initial data into the system for further processing by the subsequent layers. <br>
These neurons are added to another variable called weight, which determines the connection between the two neurons. Each connection of neurons have their own weight.
Moreover, a bias value is then added to the total value calculated using the above two values.
In the second layer- HIDDEN LAYER after all those summations of values, the neuron finally applies a function to the output of the hidden layer called the activation function, for a non-liner functional mapping between the inputs and response variables. In simple words the products of inputs(X) and their corresponding weights (W) is applied the activation function f(x) to it to get the output of that layer and is then feed  as input to the next layer.<br>
Consider randomly initialize weights-w1, w2, w3.
Then the data at input layer is multiplied with weights to form hidden layer<br>
<blockquote>
h1 = (x1 * w1) + (x2 * w1)<br>
h2 = (x1 * w2) + (x2 * w2)<br>
h3 = (x1 * w3) + (x2 * w3)<br>
</blockquote>
Finally the output of the hidden layer is passed through activation function to form the guessed output, 
    y= f( h1 , h2, h3 )
The last layer-OUTPUT LAYER of the neural network collects and transmits the information in a way it has been designed to give. Then the data at input layer is multiplied with weights to form hidden layer<br>
